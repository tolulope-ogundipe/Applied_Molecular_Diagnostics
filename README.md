# Applied_Molecular_Diagnostics
Documentation of Laboratory workflows and quality-oriented documentation in molecular diagnostics, microbiome analysis, and food safety

# Applied Molecular Biology & Laboratory Practice
This repository documents applied laboratory workflows, quality control practices, and supervisory experience across molecular diagnostics, microbiome research, and food safety systems.

The materials reflect hands-on work in research, diagnostic, and production-linked laboratories rather than theoretical coursework.
## Focus Areas
- Molecular diagnostics (PCR, qPCR, pathogen detection)
- Microbiome analysis (16S rRNA sequencing, QIIME2)
- Laboratory quality control and ISO-aligned practices
- Food safety, poultry production, and slaughter unit supervision
- Zoonotic and veterinary public health research
