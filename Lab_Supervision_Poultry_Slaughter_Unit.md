# Quality Control & ISO-Style Laboratory Practices

## Overview
This document outlines quality control practices, laboratory organization, and compliance-aligned procedures applied during my work in molecular diagnostics, microbiology laboratories, and animal production systems. These practices are informed by ISO 17025 principles, biosafety guidelines, and routine laboratory operations in research and diagnostic settings.

## Laboratory Quality Framework
Quality assurance activities were structured around the following pillars:
- Traceability of samples and reagents  
- Accuracy and reproducibility of analytical results  
- Equipment performance and environmental control  
- Documentation and audit readiness  
- Biosafety and contamination prevention  

## Sample Handling & Traceability
- Unique sample identification and labeling at intake  
- Separation of pre-PCR, post-PCR, and sequencing workflows  
- Use of batch records for DNA/RNA extraction and amplification  
- Controlled storage conditions for biological materials  
- Chain-of-custody awareness for diagnostic and surveillance samples  

## Molecular Analysis Quality Control
Applied during PCR, qPCR, and sequencing workflows:
- Inclusion of positive, negative, and extraction controls  
- Assessment of amplification efficiency and Ct consistency  
- Monitoring for cross-contamination during nucleic acid handling  
- Evaluation of DNA/RNA concentration and purity prior to downstream analysis  
- Re-run criteria defined for failed or borderline assays  

## Equipment Monitoring & Maintenance
- Daily temperature checks for refrigerators, freezers, and incubators  
- Routine calibration awareness for pipettes and thermocyclers  
- Equipment performance logs maintained during laboratory activities  
- Visual inspection of instruments prior to use  
- Immediate reporting of deviations or malfunctions
  
## Documentation & Record Keeping
- Accurate recording of laboratory activities in notebooks and digital logs  
- Clear annotation of protocols, deviations, and corrective actions  
- Data integrity maintained through version-controlled files  
- Alignment with internal SOPs and institutional guidelines  

## Biosafety & Contamination Control
- Compliance with BSL-2 laboratory practices  
- Proper use of PPE and biosafety cabinets  
- Decontamination of work surfaces before and after procedures  
- Waste segregation and biohazard disposal according to regulations  
- Awareness of zoonotic risk during sample processing  

## Quality Control in Production & Slaughter Units
Applied during supervision in poultry farming and slaughter operations:
- Hygiene monitoring within processing areas  
- Sampling for microbial and quality assessment  
- Coordination between laboratory testing and production flow  
- Reporting of anomalies affecting food safety or animal health  
- Support of quality compliance during routine operations  

## Continuous Improvement
- Participation in protocol optimization and workflow refinement  
- Openness to corrective actions following QC deviations  
- Alignment with best practices in molecular diagnostics and food safety  
- Contribution to quality discussions within multidisciplinary teams
  
## Relevance to Translational & Industrial Settings
These quality practices support:
- Reliable pathogen detection  
- Food safety assurance  
- Zoonotic disease surveillance  
- Compliance with accreditation and regulatory standards  
- Integration of laboratory data into decision-making processes
