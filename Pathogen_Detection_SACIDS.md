# Pathogen Detection Workflow – SACIDS Surveillance Context

## Overview
This document describes a generalized laboratory workflow for pathogen detection as applied within disease surveillance and outbreak-response settings. The workflow reflects experience gained in high-impact infectious disease environments, including zoonotic and transboundary pathogens.

Pathogens encountered include viral agents of public and animal health importance such as:
- SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
- African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV)
- Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus (PPRV)
- Viral Hemorrhagic Fever agents (e.g., Marburg virus)

## Surveillance Context
Laboratory activities are embedded within a One Health surveillance framework, integrating animal, human, and environmental health considerations. Diagnostic outputs support:
- Early detection and confirmation of outbreaks
- Risk assessment and reporting
- Cross-sectoral decision-making

## Step 1: Sample Reception and Biosafety
- Samples received from field surveillance teams or diagnostic partners
- Verification of sample type, labeling, and integrity
- Handling performed under appropriate biosafety conditions
- Chain-of-custody and traceability maintained

## Step 2: Nucleic Acid Extraction
- Viral RNA or DNA extracted using validated commercial kits
- Sample-specific workflows applied (blood, swabs, tissue, fecal material)
- Inclusion of extraction controls where applicable
- Extracted nucleic acids stored under controlled conditions

## Step 3: Molecular Detection
- PCR or RT-qPCR assays used for pathogen detection
- Assays selected based on surveillance objectives and pathogen targets
- Inclusion of positive, negative, and no-template controls
- Strict contamination-prevention practices followed

## Step 4: Amplification Monitoring and Quality Control
- Real-time amplification curves evaluated for assay performance
- Ct values assessed within expected diagnostic ranges
- Control performance verified prior to result validation
- Identification of inconclusive or inhibited samples

## Step 5: Result Interpretation and Reporting
- Results interpreted in line with assay validation criteria
- Findings communicated to surveillance coordinators or authorities
- Documentation completed to support traceability and audit requirements
- Escalation of positive or suspect results according to response protocols

## Step 6: Data Management and Documentation
- Analytical results recorded in laboratory logs or electronic systems
- Metadata linked to sample origin and collection context
- Deviations, repeat analyses, or anomalies documented
- Compliance with institutional and regulatory standards maintained
  
## Role of Molecular Diagnostics in Outbreak Response
- Rapid confirmation of suspected cases
- Support for epidemiological investigations
- Contribution to regional and cross-border disease monitoring
- Integration into One Health and transdisciplinary response strategies

## Notes
This document reflects applied laboratory practice in surveillance and outbreak settings. Specific primers, probe sequences, cycling parameters, and proprietary diagnostic protocols are intentionally excluded.
