# PCR and qPCR Workflow – Molecular Diagnostics Experience

## Overview
This document describes my hands-on experience with PCR and qPCR workflows applied to animal health, zoonotic disease surveillance, and translational research. The focus is on accurate sample handling, assay setup, quality control, and result interpretation rather than protocol development.

## Sample Types Handled
- Whole blood
- Serum and plasma
- Fecal samples
- Tissue samples
- Environmental samples (where applicable)

Samples were processed following biosafety and laboratory quality standards relevant to diagnostic and research laboratories.

## DNA/RNA Extraction
- Extraction performed using commercially available kits appropriate for sample type
- Emphasis on contamination prevention, proper controls, and sample traceability
- Quality and concentration checks performed prior to downstream applications

## PCR / qPCR Assay Setup
- Preparation of reaction mixes according to validated protocols
- Use of positive controls, negative controls, and no-template controls (NTCs)
- Careful plate setup and documentation to ensure reproducibility
- Familiarity with both conventional PCR and real-time PCR platforms

## Data Analysis and Interpretation
- Ct value evaluation for qPCR assays
- Assessment of amplification curves and melt curves where applicable
- Identification of failed reactions or potential inhibition
- Results interpreted in the context of controls and sample quality

## Troubleshooting Experience
Common issues addressed include:
- Low or no amplification
- Unexpected Ct values
- Contamination concerns
- Variability between technical replicates

Corrective actions were taken following laboratory best practices and supervisor guidance.

## Application Areas
- Zoonotic and transboundary disease surveillance
- Livestock and animal health diagnostics
- Research applications supporting One Health and translational studies

## Notes
This document reflects practical laboratory experience and workflow familiarity. Specific protocols, proprietary methods, and sensitive data are intentionally excluded.
