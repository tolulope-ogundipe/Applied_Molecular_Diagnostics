# Quality Control & ISO-Style Laboratory Practices

## Overview
This document outlines laboratory quality control practices aligned with ISO-style principles commonly applied in molecular biology, diagnostics, and food safety laboratories. The focus is on data integrity, traceability, and reproducibility across routine and research-based workflows.

These practices have been applied in molecular diagnostics, microbiology, and animal health laboratories.

## Laboratory Environment and Organization
- Clear separation of pre-PCR, post-PCR, and sequencing areas
- Unidirectional workflow to minimize cross-contamination
- Routine surface and equipment decontamination
- Controlled access to sensitive laboratory zones

## Sample Handling and Traceability
- Unique sample identification codes assigned at receipt
- Sample metadata recorded in digital systems
- Chain-of-custody maintained from receipt to analysis
- Proper labeling of tubes, plates, and storage units
- Defined storage conditions based on sample type

## Reagent and Consumable Management
- Reagents labeled with preparation date, expiry date, and operator initials
- Use of aliquots to reduce freeze–thaw cycles
- Lot numbers documented for critical reagents
- Verification of reagent performance before routine use

## Equipment Calibration and Maintenance
- Routine calibration of pipettes and analytical equipment
- Maintenance schedules followed for thermal cyclers, centrifuges, and sequencers
- Equipment performance checks documented
- Faults recorded and addressed before continued use

## Molecular Assay Quality Control
- Inclusion of positive, negative, and no-template controls
- Replicate testing where applicable
- Monitoring of amplification curves and Ct value consistency
- Validation of assay sensitivity and specificity
- Documentation of deviations from expected results

## Data Quality and Documentation
- Raw data retained and backed up securely
- Version control applied to analysis workflows
- Clear annotation of parameters used during analysis
- Results reviewed before reporting or downstream use
- All modifications documented and justified

## Contamination Prevention Measures
- Use of aerosol-resistant tips
- Dedicated consumables for sensitive assays
- Regular environmental monitoring
- Strict adherence to PPE requirements
- Immediate response to suspected contamination events

## Biosafety and Compliance
- Compliance with institutional biosafety guidelines
- Proper waste segregation and disposal
- Training in handling infectious or hazardous materials
- Risk assessments conducted before new procedures

## Continuous Quality Improvement
- Periodic review of laboratory procedures
- Staff training and competency assessment
- Alignment with evolving regulatory or project requirements

## Notes
This document reflects applied laboratory quality practices. It is not a formal ISO certification manual but demonstrates operational alignment with ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 principles commonly expected in regulated laboratory environments.
